                <h1>Kanka-Foundry migration</h1>
                <p>You have recently updated the Kanka-Foundry module from 1.x to this current version. This update
                brought a lot of big changes to how the module imports and handles data from Kanka, in order to allow
                for an improved user experience and more features.</p>
                <p>You currently have</p>
                {journalList}
                {folderList}
                <p>that were created by Kanka-Foundry and need to be updated in order to properly work and take
                advantage of the new features. One change is, that journal entries imported from kanka are no longer
                editable. That was never truly supported anyways, as changes were overwritten with the next import and
                could not be synced back to Kanka.</p>
                <p>If you have changed any of the imported journal entries by hand:</p>
                <p><big style=\"color: red;\"><strong>Backup your data now! Upgrading will overwrite all imported
                journal entries!</strong></big></p><p>Please refer to the modules
                <a href=\"https://github.com/eXaminator/kanka-foundry\" target=\"_blank\">Github repository</a> to see
                all changes of the new version. If you want to keep the old version, you'll have to skip the migration
                now, manually downgrade to an older release (all available at github) and lock the module version in the
                package manager screen (a new feature of Foundry 0.8.x).</p>
                <p> Do you want to upgrade your existing journal entries to the new version? <strong>This will start a
                reimport from Kanka for all imported journal entries and overwrite the versions you currently have
                synced.</strong> This might take a few minutes, depending on the size of your Kanka campaign and the
                amount of synced entries. You will receive a notification once it's done.</p>
                <h2>But I already ran this migration!</h2>
                <p> You might have synced entries from multiple campaigns or perhaps you deleted an entity in Kanka
                but not the imported entry in Foundry. This migration only updates entries from the
                currently selected campaign ({campaignName}). If you keep getting this message, change the selected
                campaign in the modules settings and reload your browser to try again. Or check each entry individually
                to see if it still exists in Kanka.</p>
                <p>Should you keep running into trouble, please let me know by creating an issue in Github.</p>
            action:
                yes: Update and overwrite my entries
                no: Remind me again next time!
        success: The Kanka-Foundry migration is done. Successfully migrated {success} of {expected} entries.
        nothingToDo: Kanka-Foundry could not find any entries to migrate. Please check that you have selected the correct campaign.
