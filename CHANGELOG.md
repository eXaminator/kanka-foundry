# [2.0.0](https://github.com/eXaminator/kanka-foundry/compare/1.9.7...2.0.0) (2021-05-29)

This is a big update!

Please make a backup of your Journal Entries before updating, just to be sure!

In this release I have rewritten almost everything about this module. Instead of just writing a Journal Entry with some formatted HTML in it, it will actually save a full snapshot of the Kanka entity and display it using a fully customized template. This allows for a cleaner and elaborated user interface and also opens the door for some future improvements that weren't possible before.

## Breaking Changes
* Previously imported Journal Entries are not compatible with this version, but the module will prompt you to update old entries and offers you a way to do so. Please back up you world data before doing this if you don't want to risk having to reimport and reorganize data by hand.

## Features

### General
* Add support for Foundry 0.8 (but it is still compatible with 0.7)
* Improve error handling in most places

### Browser
* Add a gridded view to the Kanka Entity Browser
* Improve the display for entities that are outdated
* Add button to easily update all outdated entries

### Journal Entries
* Enhance Journal Entries by using custom templates that use a tabbed layout to display all the information Kanka has to offer. This is a complete overhaul of how theses Journal Entries look and behave. Take a look at the README to see what this looks like.
* Improve permission handling by actually displaying different data to Foundry users depending on their permissions of each Journal Entry.
* Show which information are secret and will thusly not be displayed for non-owners of that Journal Entry.
* Add button to each Journal Entry to update that entity directly from there (Beware: This uses up more API requests than doing it via the Entity Browser. So only use this for individual updates, not to update multiple entities in a short time See API Limits in the readme).
